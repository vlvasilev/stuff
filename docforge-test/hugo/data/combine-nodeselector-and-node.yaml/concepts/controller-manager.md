# Gardener Controller Manager

The Gardener Controller Manager (often refered to as "GCM") is a component that runs next to the Gardener API server, similar to the Kubernetes Controller Manager.
It runs several control loops that do not require talking to any seed or shoot cluster.
Also, as of today it exposes a HTTPS server that is serving several endpoints for webhooks for certain resources.

This document explains the various functionalities of the Gardener Controller Manager and their purpose.

## Control Loops

### `Project` Controller

This controller consists out of two reconciliation loops:
The main loop is reconciling `Project` resources while the second loop is controlling the necessary actions for stale projects.

#### "Main" Reconciler

This reconciler will create a dedicated `Namespace` prefixed with `garden-` for each `Project` resource.
The name of the namespace can either be stated in the `.spec.namespace`, or it will be auto-generated by the reconciler.
If `.spec.namespace` is set then it creates it if it does not exist yet.
Otherwise, it tries to adopt it.
This will only succeed if the `Namespace` was previously labeled with `gardener.cloud/role=project` and `project.gardener.cloud/name=<project-name>`.
This is to prevent that end-users can adopt arbitrary namespaces and escalate their privileges, e.g. the `kube-system` namespace.

After the namespace was created/adopted the reconciler creates several `ClusterRole`s and `ClusterRoleBinding`s that allow the project members to access related resources based on their roles.
These RBAC resources are prefixed with `gardener.cloud:system:project{-member,-viewer}:<project-name>`.
Gardener administrators and extension developers can define their own roles, see [this document](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/extensions/project-roles.md) for more information.

In addition, operators can configure the Project controller to maintain a default [ResourceQuota](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/) for project namespaces.
Quotas can especially limit the creation of user facing resources, e.g. `Shoots`, `SecretBindings`, `Secrets` and thus protect the Garden cluster from massive resource exhaustion but also enable operators to align quotas with respective enterprise policies.

> :warning: **Gardener itself is not exempted from configured quotas**. For example, Gardener creates `Secrets` for every shoot cluster in the project namespace and at the same time increases the available quota count. Please mind this additional resource consumption.

The GCM configuration provides a template section `controllers.project.quotas` where such a ResourceQuota (see example below) can be deposited.

```yaml
controllers:
  project:
    quotas:
    - config:
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: ResourceQuota
        spec:
          hard:
            count/shoots.core.gardener.cloud: "100"
            count/secretbindings.core.gardener.cloud: "10"
            count/secrets: "800"
      projectSelector: {}
```

The Project controller takes the shown `config` and creates a `ResourceQuota` with the name `gardener` in the project namespace.
If a `ResourceQuota` resource with the name `gardener` already exists, the controller will only update fields in `spec.hard` which are **unavailable** at that time.
An optional `projectSelector` narrows down the amount of projects that are equipped with the given `config`.
If multiple configs match for a project, then only the first match in the list is applied to the project namespace.

The `.status.phase` of the `Project` resources will be set to `Ready` or `Failed` by the reconciler to indicate whether the reconciliation loop was performed successfully.
Also, it will generate `Event`s to provide further information about its operations.

#### "Stale Projects" Reconciler

As Gardener is a large-scale Kubernetes as a Service it is designed for being used by a large amount of end-users.
Over time, it is likely to happen that some of the hundreds or thousands of `Project` resources are no longer actively used.

Gardener offers the "stale projects" reconciler which will take care of identifying such stale projects, marking them with a "warning", and eventually deleting them after a certain time period.
This reconciler is enabled by default and works as following:

1. Projects are considered as "stale"/not actively used when all of the following conditions apply: The namespace associated with the `Project` does not have any...
    1. `Shoot` resources.
    1. `Plant` resources.
    1. `BackupEntry` resources.
    1. `Secret` resources that are referenced by a `SecretBinding` that is in use by a `Shoot` (not necessarily in the same namespace).
    1. `Quota` resources that are referenced by a `SecretBinding` that is in use by a `Shoot` (not necessarily in the same namespace).

If a project is considered "stale" then its `.status.staleSinceTimestamp` will be set to the time when it was first detected to be stale.
If it gets actively used again this timestamp will be removed.
After some time the `.status.staleAutoDeleteTimestamp` will be set to a timestamp after which Gardener will auto-delete the `Project` resource if it still is not actively used.

The component configuration of the Gardener Controller Manager offers to configure the following options:

* `minimumLifetimeDays`: Don't consider newly created `Project`s as "stale" too early to give people/end-users some time to onboard and get familiar with the system. The "stale project" reconciler won't set any timestamp for `Project`s younger than `minimumLifetimeDays`. When you change this value then projects marked as "stale" may be no longer marked as "stale" in case they are young enough, or vice versa.
* `staleGracePeriodDays`: Don't compute auto-delete timestamps for stale `Project`s that are unused for only less than `staleGracePeriodDays`. This is to not unnecessarily make people/end-users nervous "just because" they haven't actively used their `Project` for a given amount of time. When you change this value then already assigned auto-delete timestamps may be removed again if the new grace period is not yet exceeded.
* `staleExpirationTimeDays`: Expiration time after which stale `Project`s are finally auto-deleted (after `.status.staleSinceTimestamp`). If this value is changed and an auto-delete timestamp got already assigned to the projects then the new value will only take effect if it's increased. Hence, decreasing the `staleExpirationTimeDays` will not decrease already assigned auto-delete timestamps.

> Gardener administrators/operators can exclude specific `Project`s from the stale check by annotating the related `Namespace` resource with `project.gardener.cloud/skip-stale-check=true`.

### Event Controller

With the Gardener Event Controller you can prolong the lifespan of events related to Shoot clusters.
This is an optional controller which will become active once you provide the below mentioned configuration.

All events in K8s are deleted after a configurable time-to-live (controlled via a [kube-apiserver argument](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/) called `--event-ttl` (defaulting to 1 hour)).
The need to prolong the time-to-live for Shoot cluster events frequently arises when debugging customer issues on live systems.
This controller leaves events involving Shoots untouched while deleting all other events after a configured time.
In order to activate it, provide the following configuration:

* `concurrentSyncs`: The amount of goroutines scheduled for reconciling events.
* `ttlNonShootEvents`: When an event reaches this time-to-live it gets deleted unless it is a Shoot-related event (defaults to `1h`, equivalent to the `event-ttl` default).

> :warning: In addition, you should also configure the `--event-ttl` for the kube-apiserver to define an upper-limit of how long Shoot-related events should be stored.
The `--event-ttl` should be larger than the `ttlNonShootEvents` or this controller will have no effect.

### Shoot Reference Controller

Shoot objects may specify references to further objects in the Garden cluster which are required for certain features.
For example, users can configure various DNS providers via `.spec.dns.providers` and usually need to refer to a corresponding `secret` with valid DNS provider credentials inside.
Such objects need a special protection against deletion requests as long as they are still being referenced by one or multiple shoots.

Therefore, the Shoot Reference Controller scans shoot clusters for referenced objects and adds the finalizer `gardener.cloud/reference-protection` to their `.metadata.finalizers` list.
The scanned shoot also gets this finalizer to enable a proper garbage collection in case the Gardener-Controller-Manager is offline at the moment of an incoming deletion request.
When an object is not actively referenced anymore because the shoot specification has changed or all related shoots were deleted (are in deletion), the controller will remove the added finalizer again, so that the object can safely be deleted or garbage collected.

The Shoot Reference Controller can inspect the following references:

- Enabled by default:
  - DNS provider secrets (`.spec.dns.provider`)
- Disabled by default:
  - Audit policy configmaps (`.spec.kubernetes.kubeAPIServer.auditConfig.auditPolicy.configMapRef`)

> If you want to enable the audit policy configmap protection then you can set the `.controllers.shootReference.protectAuditPolicyConfigMaps` to `true` in the component configuration.

Further checks might be added in the future.


### Shoot Retry Controller

The Shoot Retry Controller is responsible for retrying certain failed Shoots. Currently the controller retries only failed Shoots with error code `ERR_INFRA_RATE_LIMITS_EXCEEDED`.

### Seed Controller

The Seed controller in the Gardener Controller Manager reconciles `Seed` objects with the help of the following reconcilers.

#### "Main" Reconciler

This reconciliation loop takes care about seed related operations in the Garden cluster. When a new `Seed` object is created
the reconciler creates a new `Namespace` in the garden cluster `seed-<seed-name>`. `Namespaces` dedicated to single
seed clusters allow us to segregate access permissions i.e., a Gardenlet must not have permissions to access objects in
all `Namespaces` in the Garden cluster.
There are objects in a Garden environment which are created once by the operator e.g., default domain secret,
alerting credentials, and required for operations happening in the Gardenlet. Therefore, we not only need a seed specific
`Namespace` but also a copy of these "shared" objects.

The "main" reconciler takes care about this replication:

| Kind   | Namespace  |Label Selector  |
|:-------:|:---------:|:-----:|
| Secret | garden | gardener.cloud/role |

#### "Backup Bucket" Reconciler

Every time a `BackupBucket` object is created or updated, the referenced `Seed` object is enqueued for reconciliation.
It's the reconciler's task to check the `status` subresource of all existing `BackupBuckets` that belong to this seed.
If at least one `BackupBucket` has `.status.lastError`, the seed condition `BackupBucketsReady` will turn `false` and
consequently the seed is considered as `NotReady`. Once the `BackupBucket` is healthy again, the seed will be re-queued
and the condition will turn `true`.

#### "Lifecycle" Reconciler

The "Lifecycle" reconciler processes `Seed` objects which are enqueued every 10 seconds in order to check if the responsible
Gardenlet is still responding and operable. Therefore, it checks renewals via `Lease` objects of the seed in the garden cluster
which are renewed regularly by the Gardenlet.
In case a `Lease` is not renewed for the configured amount in `config.controllers.seed.monitorPeriod.duration`, the reconciler
assumes that the Gardenlet stopped operating and updates the `GardenletReady` condition to `Unknown`.
Additionally, conditions and constraints of all `Shoot` resources scheduled on the affected seed are set to `Unknown` as well
because a striking Gardenlet won't be able to maintain these conditions any more.

### "Bastion" Controller

`Bastion` resources have a limited lifetime, which can be extended up to a certain amount by performing a heartbeat on
them. The `Bastion` controller is responsible for deleting expired or rotten `Bastion`s.

* "expired" means a `Bastion` has exceeded its `status.ExpirationTimestamp`.
* "rotten" means a `Bastion` is older than the configured `maxLifetime`.

The `maxLifetime` is an option on the `Bastion` controller and defaults to 24 hours.

The deletion triggers the gardenlet to perform the necessary cleanups in the Seed cluster, so some time can pass between
deletion and the `Bastion` actually disappearing. Clients like `gardenctl` are advised to not re-use `Bastion`s whose
deletion timestamp has been set already.

Refer to [GEP-15](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/proposals/15-manage-bastions-and-ssh-key-pair-rotation.md) for more information on the lifecycle of
`Bastion` resources.
